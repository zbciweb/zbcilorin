# Work done so far as at 23/6/2023

I newer components, i added an extra folder called Utils. The Utils allows us to have reusable items for our components. Currently, i have galleryImages.js which is to cater for all gallery images. I have ministries.js which allows us to cater for all ministries.js, then the pastoral&diaconates.js caters for pastors&diaconates in the about us page

I also removed nav and footer from all the pages. I used a single nav and footer wrapper for all pages

Further, i added newer components

1. /Gallery.js
2. About/pastorsandDiaconates.jsx
3. Few Edition on the footer component. Component now has some of the church programs and the map tp the church

The following are the pages i have worked on

### `Route index`

Gave nav and footer wrapper for all pages

### `Home`

imported a gallery component. This would enable us to reuse the gallery component for the page

### `About`

imported the pastoranddiaconate component to fill the pastors and diaconate page

### `Ministries`

imported the ministries component to fill the pastors and diaconate page
Added links to the individual ministries
